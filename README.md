Theatre Ticketing/Seating Chart Software

## Notice

This software is not complete and far from tested or stable. There's also a bunch of security issues that I am aware of. If you come across this and want to work on it, _please_ email me at [me@jaredbates.net](mailto:me@jaredbates.net). I would be glad to help you and would greatly welcome any changes you suggest.
