Theatre Ticketing/Seating Chart Software

### This software will eventually be replaced by my new application, [XiTickets](https://github.com/XiTickets), which will have a much more organized structure. This is only here for archival purposes.

## Notice

This software is not complete and far from tested or stable. There's also a bunch of security issues that I am aware of. If you come across this and want to work on it, _please_ email me at [me@jaredbates.net](mailto:me@jaredbates.net). I would be glad to help you and would greatly welcome any changes you suggest.
